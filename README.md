# zeroranger-palette-maker
An app to create custom palettes for ZeroRanger. Made in GameMaker to replicate exactly how ZeroRanger renders (it is also made with GameMaker).
Instructions on how to import your custom palettes into ZeroRanger are inside the app, click the "i" button next to the export button. 
Making the palettes themselves is pretty straightforward.
If you have any issues at any point in the process please make an issue on this Github.
